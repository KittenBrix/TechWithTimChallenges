Coding Challenge #26
Write a function that takes two strings as input and calculates the similarity score between them based on their token overlap.
A token is defined as a word separated by spaces. The similarity score should be the ratio of the number of common tokens to 
the total number of unique tokens in both strings combined. Return the score as a float between 0 and 1, where 0 means no similarity
and 1 means identical strings.
